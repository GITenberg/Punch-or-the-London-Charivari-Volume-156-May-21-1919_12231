<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>"We thought it was to be a <i>Peace</i> Conference," remarks the
<i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> sadly. Instead of which it turned out to
be another Diet of Worms.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Wanted a Dock Examiner," says a technical paper advertisement.
Now if they had only wanted a Duke examiner we have the very man in
mind.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Several correspondents have written to <i>The Daily Express</i>
asking whether it is not unlucky to be married on a Friday. Our own
experience is that it doesn't make much difference which day it
is.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We learn on good authority that an airman recently flew from
Newfoundland to the English coast, but immediately returned as he
considered that the weather was unfavourable for landing. As the
whole affair appears to have been hushed up it is thought that he
was of American nationality.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"A seasonable dish," says <i>Household Hints</i>, "is <i>crab au
gratis</i>." We can only say that in our own experience it never
seems to be in season at the smartest restaurants.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An American Army doctor has discovered that sea-sickness
originates in the ears. This confirms the old theory that persons
who sleep with both ears pressed against the pillow are never
sea-sick.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Presents given prior to engagements, says Judge CLUER, are in
the nature of bait and cannot be recovered. Once the angler is
safely hooked a different situation arises.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"I am confident," writes "J.E.P." in <i>The Daily Mail</i>,
"that nineteen out of twenty men do not know what they should do on
being bitten by a mad dog." The common practice of trying to bite
the dog back is admittedly inadequate.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The London County Council have decided not to remove the marks
of damage done by aircraft to the base of Cleopatra's Needle. It
seems that they have also had to refuse the request of some
curio-hunters who asked if they might have the indentations as
mementos.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Owing to the inflated price of silver, a contemporary points
out, the shilling now contains only ten-pence half-penny worth of
silver. More important however is the fact that, owing to the
inflated cheek of dairymen, it only contains three pennyworth of
milk.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Singing," says Dr. HENRY COWARD, "is a valuable preventive
against influenza." It is also known that certain streptococci have
an intense dislike to the trombone.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The parishioners of All Saints' Church, South Acton, are invited
by the clergy to say what they would like to be preached to about.
The little boy who wrote that he would like a sermon on the proper
way to feed white rats is still hopeful.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It appears that a Wallasey licensee, in order to satisfy his
customers, sent a sample of Government ale to be analysed. We
understand that the analyst reported that there was nothing in
it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"I don't go to the pictures," says Mr. H.G. WELLS. It is not
clear whether the Academy or the cinema is meant, but it shows that
the famous novelist is, after all, only human, like so many of
us.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>As a result of high prices, says <i>The Daily Express</i>,
ladies may now be seen at Longchamps without stockings. We have
noticed similar signs of the high price of ladies' dresses in this
country.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Sir NEVILLE MACREADY'S statement that "burglars to-day often
resort to violence" has caused much annoyance, and the famous
police chief is to be asked to receive a deputation of London
burglars to discuss the point.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Under no circumstances, says a medical leaflet, should flies be
allowed in the house. If they knock at the front-door and then rush
past you, send for a policeman.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Streatham resident is offering a reward of ten shillings for
the return of a "ginger" cat which has been lost. As the owner has
shown no other traces of the effect of the hot weather the
authorities have decided not to pursue the case.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Things are coming to a pretty pass in Ireland. Just because a
man attempted to murder somebody in County Armagh the police have
threatened to arrest him.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An ex-special constable, relating his experiences in a weekly
magazine, mentions that he once found a perfectly good alarum-clock
on the doorstep of a neighbour's house. Further investigation
would, no doubt, have resulted in the discovery of the milk-jug on
the bedroom mantelpiece.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"A young man should kiss a girl on either the left or the right
cheek," says a writer on hygiene in a weekly paper. As the option
of either cheek is given, many young men will no doubt hesitate
between the two.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An evening paper reports that a live shell was found "laying" in
an open field near Southend. This seems a sure sign that the
nesting-season is now in full swing, and it seems a pity that we
did not think of this method of shell-production during the
War.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"No honest German," says Herr SCHEIDEMANN, "can possibly sign
the Peace Treaty." The best plan, perhaps, would be to call for
volunteers and take the risk as to qualification.</p>

<h2>THE BEETLE OF BUDA-PESTH.</h2>
<p class="center">AN UNRECORDED EPISODE OF THE GREAT WAR.</p>
<p>The War being now practically at an end and Austria-Hungary
irrevocably broken up, I am able to recount an adventure, in which
I was involved, that occurred at Buda-Pesth in the second week of
August, 1914.</p>
<p>Seated at a caf&eacute; on the famous Franz-Josef Quai, I was
sipping coffee, after an excellent lunch, with Frederick, whose
surname I will not mention in case I get into trouble for relating
the incident before Peace is actually signed. The sun shone
joyously down upon the kaleidoscope of gaily dressed people
promenading by the cool waters of the Danube, and we sat
engrossed&mdash;I in the charm of the scene, and Frederick in that
of individual beauties who passed to and fro.</p>
<p>Suddenly I noticed that he was staring intently upon the ground
a few yards in front of him. I asked him what was the matter.</p>
<p>"Perceive," he replied in a very serious tone, "a small beetle
of the order of Coleoptera making its way across the pavement?"</p>
<p>"I do perceive it," I replied; "but what about it?"</p>
<p>"Does it not occur to you," he continued, "that it is a very
remarkable thing that that beetle should have already travelled six
feet across the most crowded promenade in Buda-Pesth without having
been trodden on?"</p>
<p>Being used to Frederick I do not take him too seriously and made
no reply, intending to brush the incident aside, but I found my
gaze continually returning to Coleopteron, conscious of that
peculiar fascination which attracts one to impending tragedy. It
was evident that he had just left the caf&eacute; and was hurrying
across the promenade to catch the little steamer which was due to
leave in ten minutes for Ofen. It was also evident to any thinking
individual that there must be some extraordinarily urgent reason
for his wishing to catch the boat which justified him in taking the
awful risks which he was incurring. The position was full of human
interest and I became as intrigued as Frederick.</p>
<p>It seemed that Coleopteron was under some divine protection
which enabled him to elude so large a crowd. One lady stepped right
on him, but apparently, by a piece of brilliant footwork, he
managed to get in the arch between the sole and the heel and so
survive. Another promenader brushed him with his boot and knocked
him over, but he doggedly continued on his way.</p>
<p>I was conscious of a greatly accelerated beating of my heart and
noticed that Frederick was perspiring freely.</p>
<p>Half-way across the twenty-foot pavement Coleopteron was sniffed
at by a dog and our hearts stopped beating, but again he was saved
by the fact that the dog was on a chain and just hadn't time to eat
him before he was dragged after his mistress.</p>
<p>I noticed now that Frederick's eyes were protruding from his
head and that he was muttering to himself. I too felt the strain
telling upon me, A shrill whistle from the little steamer warning
passengers to hurry up was immediately responded to by Coleopteron,
who increased his speed to the utmost, when suddenly Frederick's
trembling hand caught mine.</p>
<p>"Look!" he said, and, following his gaze, I saw approaching
twelve gendarmes. We did not speak; we did not need to invite each
other's views; our minds had but a single thought&mdash;Coleopteron
could not possibly escape twenty-four Hungarian Government
boots.</p>
<p>On scurried our little friend and on came the gendarmes. I was
conscious of a feeling of physical sickness, and Frederick groaned
aloud. As the dreadful moment of contact approached we shut our
eyes tight and each gripped the other's hand. How long we remained
like this I cannot tell, for we were both afraid to look and see
the my smudge on the pavement indicating a hero's end; but
eventually, by mutual arrangement, we opened our eyes, and then we
saw&mdash;not a smudge, but Coleopteron still advancing quite
unconcerned. It was a miracle.</p>
<p>"I can't stand it any longer," cried Frederick, to the amazement
of those sitting about us outside the caf&eacute;, "I shall go
mad!" and, leaping up from his seat, he rushed across the promenade
and, taking from his pocket a picture-postcard of some Hungarian
beauty, he coaxed Coleopteron to walk on to it, then bore him
triumphantly back and deposited him upon the leaf of a palm which
overhung our table.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards the little steamer whistled again and left
the quay.</p>
<p>Frederick remained silent for some time as befits a man who has
saved a life, and then arose to have a look at Coleopteron and
doubtless to make himself better known to the little hero; but to
his pained surprise Coleopteron was not to be found. All over that
palm he searched in vain and on the floor; then suddenly he emitted
a gurgling sound and I saw that he was in the grip of deep emotion.
There was a look on his face I had never seen before, and I
anxiously asked him what had happened. For some time he could not
speak, but stood gazing vacantly into space. At last, with parched
lips, he spoke.</p>
<p>"Look in the milk-jug!" he said, and sank into his chair.</p>
<p>For a moment I thought that Frederick had been poisoned, and
then I realised the truth, for there in the hot milk floated the
corpse of Coleopteron.</p>
<p>"Why did he do it?" pleaded Frederick with a break in his
voice.</p>
<p>"Because," I replied, "you hadn't the sense to realise that he
was staking his all on catching that boat, and, instead of helping
him, you brought him back to where he started from."</p>
<hr />
<p>Early the next morning, at Frederick's desire, we left
Buda-Pesth <i>en route</i> for the Swiss Frontier. It was
impossible, if he was to retain his reason, to stay longer in a
city that had for him such tragic associations.</p>

<h2>A CAPITAL OUTLAY.</h2>
<p>It was, in a sense, mutual. We had chickens; the chickens had
us. On the other hand, they had the best of the bargain. We kept
them; and they did not keep us.</p>
<p>My aunt insisted that we <i>must</i> keep chickens, and you know
my aunt.</p>
<p>Pardon! You don't know my aunt. She is an elderly maiden lady
who "keeps house" for me. She is eminently
practical&mdash;theoretically speaking.</p>
<p>She insisted. "With eggs at eightpence it's a sin and a shame
not to keep hens in war-time."</p>
<p>I urged that the food would cost a good many
eightpences&mdash;in war-time.</p>
<p>Her reply was "Pshaw!" (She really does say "Pshaw"&mdash;and
means it.) "Pshaw! they will live on kitchen scraps."</p>
<p>We consulted Nibletts. He has a local reputation as a chicken
expert, mainly, I believe, because he's a butcher. He recommended a
breed called Wild Oats (by which he meant, I discovered,
Wyandottes).</p>
<p>"You take my tip, Sir," he said, "and buy Wild Oats. If you'll
excuse the word&mdash;" (Nibletts is always apologising for some
term he is about to use, which promises to be inexpressibly
shocking to polite ears, and never is)&mdash;"they're
clinkers."</p>
<p>We ordered a round dozen. We also bought a hen-house fitted with
all modern conveniences. The total outlay represented a prince's
ransom; but, as I pointed out to my aunt, we had a run for our
money.</p>
<p>The hens, when they arrived, were not strictly "as per"
advertisement. We bought them as laying pullets, and they didn't
lay for quite a time&mdash;so far as we knew. Nibletts, however,
declared that they were "what you might call in the pink," and
surmised that the train journey had "put 'em off the lay, as you
might say." If eating and fighting were evidences of their being
"in the pink," those birds must have enjoyed exceptional health.
They also slept well, I believe.</p>
<p>After about a month one enormous egg arrived&mdash;an egg that
would not have disgraced a young ostrich. Its huge dimensions
worried my aunt. She wondered if they were a symptom, and consulted
Nibletts.</p>
<p>He put it down to the food. He said that kitchen scraps were "no
good for laying pullets." "That egg, lady," he said, "is what us
fanciers call&mdash;excuse me&mdash;" (I saw my aunt shudder in
anticipation)&mdash;"a bloomer. You must give 'em a lot more
meal."</p>
<p>We bought a big sack of meal&mdash;through the medium of
Nibletts. If I remember rightly it cost rather more than the
pullets.</p>
<p>Still no eggs. Then some of the hens went out of "the pink." For
instance, one developed a chronic habit of running centripetally
round a constantly diminishing circle, fainting on arriving at the
geometrical centre. My distressed aunt called in Nibletts to
prescribe. There was only one word for it&mdash;that awful word
"staggers." There was only one cure for it&mdash;death. Should he
wring its neck?</p>
<p>We feelingly withdrew, and he did it. He took the corpse away
with him, so that he presumably had a use for it.</p>
<p>Soon a second pullet went down with a considerably swollen face.
My aunt bathed it twice a day in a hot anti-septic, but to no
purpose, except that the poor thing seemed much comforted by the
fomentation. That hen was, Nibletts whispered to me, for fear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>[pg
397]</span> my aunt should overhear, "a waster." The only thing to
do was to coop it up from the rest, or they'd all go down with
it&mdash;whatever it was.</p>
<p>We cooped it up till it died. Nibletts certified the cause of
death as that unmentionable complaint, the pip.</p>
<p>Still no eggs, notwithstanding repeated appeals in the sacred
name of <i>Macduff</i>. We did, however, find out what the trouble
was.</p>
<p>The hens were eating the eggs!</p>
<p>Nibletts said&mdash;under his breath&mdash;that they were what
was known as "blighters." He recommended (deprecating the term) a
"stodger." A "stodger" proved to be an egg-shell stuffed with
bread-crumbs, mustard and the strongest photographic ammonia.</p>
<p>My aunt said it would be cruel. It was certainly rough on me.
Nibletts apologetically directed me to blow an egg&mdash;"a shop
'un 'd do." Accordingly, following his instructions, I injected or
otherwise introduced the ingredients through a small aperture. It
was the bread-crumbs that gave me most trouble; but it was the
photographic ammonia that was "cruel." The mustard went in quite
easily with a squirt.</p>
<p>I stopped the holes with paper stuck on with sealing-wax and put
the <i>oeuf farci</i> in the run. I waited to see what would
happen. It happened at once. All ten hens went for that egg in a
convergent attack, and all ten pecks got home simultaneously. The
deputation then hurriedly withdrew, with loud protests, and spent
the rest of the day wiping their beaks in the cool earth.</p>
<p>But they remained recalcitrant. They systematically
cannibalized. A cackle from the layer brought all the rest to the
spot; and I simply couldn't stay there all day to forestall the
onslaught.</p>
<p>Nibletts suggested our getting a patent laying-box, furnished
with (what he apologised to my aunt for calling) a false front. My
aunt did not at first grasp the idea, but what Nibletts did in fact
refer to was a contrivance that would admit one sitter only at a
time, subsequent unauthorised entrance being cut off by an
ingenious drop slide. Further elaborate construction also prevented
the sitter herself from turning round to peck. She had to remain
sitting till some human came and lifted her out.</p>
<p>Just one egg was laid in that patent box. The object of it was
also patent&mdash;to the hens. Nothing would induce them to use it
after that once.</p>
<p>Nibletts then recommended (if he might so describe it) a
"tit-up." That was, so to speak, a conjuring-trick of a laying-box,
which let the egg fall through a trap-door into a padded cell
beneath. My aunt thought it unnatural and feared that it might be
exhausting. Nevertheless we tried it, and extracted one solitary
egg from the basement.</p>
<p>Then, being an engineer by profession, I conceived a mechanical
means of giving those hens the scare of their lives if they
persisted in their antisocial habits. I constructed a "spoof" egg
of white enamelled metal, with hinges that opened when a catch was
touched. Inside I compressed one of those jack-in-the-box snakes
that spring out when free to do so.</p>
<p>It was quite effective&mdash;as a parlour-trick. Those hens
pecked the catch loose, and that cockatrice fairly staggered them.
It was to them a clear case of "nourishing a viper." But all was as
before.</p>
<p>Nibletts then gave up the case as (what he might be excused for
calling) a "fair corker." Should he wring their (pause) necks?</p>
<p>We thought it best so, and gave him a couple of "laying pullets"
for his trouble. The other eight kept us going monotonously for
about a month.</p>
<p>The house is still on offer. Houses are scarce just now.</p>
<p>I have sown my Wyandottes.</p>
<hr class="short" />

<h2>PROCRASTINATION.</h2>
<p>A few mornings ago I found among my letters a tragic
document&mdash;a bill. A first quick glance at it filled me with
despair, because I was luxuriating in that Fools' Paradise produced
by the illusion that one is all paid up. Of course one never is;
there is always something that one forgets, and this must have been
it; so that, instead of perfect freedom from liability, here I was
apparently still owing no less a sum than &pound;5 9<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>The figures looked familiar enough, although disconcerting, but
I rubbed my eyes when I found that they were made up of two items
that had never come my way; the first being one-and-a-half dozen
essences, &pound;3 15<i>s</i>., and the second, a dozen <i>poudre
assortie,</i> &pound;1 14<i>s</i>. It could not be for me. Essences
and powders wholesale are not in my line, nor is my acquaintance so
extensive among the Fair as these quantities would imply.</p>
<p>A moment later all my anxieties dispersed and tragedy turned to
comedy when I realised that the bill was for the hairdresser with
the same name as my own, who lives next door but one and gets so
much of my correspondence.</p>
<p>I therefore put the bill on my desk, intending to take it into
the shop when I went out; and forgot it.</p>
<p>The Russian Corps de Ballet at the Alhambra is an assemblage of
charming and gifted people who are at last giving their admirers
full measure. Now that they have a vast theatre of their own and
perform three ballets every night the old frustrated feeling that
used to tantalise us at the Opera and the Coliseum has vanished.
But I have still a grievance, and that is that the programme is so
rarely the programme that I myself would have arranged. In other
words the three ballets that form it are seldom the Big Three that
are nearest my heart. To be explicit, I want <i>Petroushka</i>, and
instead I find myself not knowing where to look while
<i>Scheherazade</i> unfolds its appalling freedoms; I want <i>Les
Sylphides</i>, and instead am given <i>Les Papillons</i>, which is
very lovely but not of an equal loveliness; and I want
<i>Carnaval</i>, and instead am offered the perplexities of <i>The
Fire Bird</i>. It happened, however, that one night recently the
perfect programme was given&mdash;<i>Carnaval, Les Sylphides</i>
and <i>Petroushka</i>; but there was not a seat in the house, and I
therefore had to stand in great discomfort, so that half the joy
evaporated.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile" (I seem to hear you say) "what of the hairdresser
who has the same name as yourself and plies his trade next door but
one? This story&mdash;which so far is a poor enough thing&mdash;was
surely to have been about him." (So I seem to hear you say.)</p>
<p>Patience! It is about him, but it is also about the evils of
procrastination. In short, it is a kind of tract.</p>
<p>On the morning after my disappointing evening at the Alhambra,
while moving some papers on my desk, I brought to light the bill
for the powder and the essences. "Good Heavens!" I murmured, "the
poor fellow will be distracted not to have this;" and I took it in
to him straightway.</p>
<p>I apologised for the delay.</p>
<p>"There is no hurry," he replied. "Accounts can wait; But I
hope," he added, taking an envelope from a drawer, "that this
letter for you is equally unimportant. It came, I'm afraid, four
days ago, and I was always meaning to bring it in, but forgot."</p>
<p>Unimportant! It was merely an invitation from the most adorable
woman in London to share her box at the Russian Ballet on the
previous night, to see what she knew was my most desired
performance, <i>Carnaval, Les Sylphides</i> and
<i>Pelroushka</i>.</p>
<p>Either the hairdresser or I must move.</p>
<p>Or we must both take a course of memory training. I believe
there is some system on the market.</p>

<h2>THE PERILS OF REVIEWING.</h2>
<p>A most unfortunate thing has happened to a friend of mine called
&mdash;&mdash; to a friend of &mdash;&mdash; to a friend of
&mdash;&mdash;. Well, I suppose the truth will have to come out. It
happened to me. Only don't tell anybody.</p>
<p>I reviewed a book the other day. It is not often I do this,
because before one can review a book one has to, or is supposed to,
read it, which wastes a good deal of time. Even that isn't an end
of the trouble. The article which follows is not really one's own,
for the wretched fellow who wrote the book is always trying to push
his way in with his views on matrimony, or the Sussex downs, or
whatever his ridiculous subject is. He expects one to say, "Mr.
Blank's treatment of <i>Hilda's</i> relations with her husband is
masterly," whereas what one wants to say is, "Putting Mr. Blank's
book on one side we may consider the larger question, whether
&mdash;&mdash;" and so consider it (alone) to the end of the
column.</p>
<p>Well, I reviewed Mr. Blank's book, <i>Rotundity</i>. As I
expected, the first draft had to be re-headed "A Corner of Old
London," and used elsewhere; Mr. Blank didn't get into it at all. I
kept promising myself a sentence: "Take <i>Rotundity,</i> for
instance, the new novel by William Blank, which, etc.," but before
I was ready for it the article was finished. In my second draft,
realizing the dangers of delay, I began at once, "This remarkable
novel," and continued so for a couple of sentences. But on reading
it through afterwards I saw at once that the first two sentences
were out of place in an article that obviously ought to be called
"The Last Swallow;" so I cut them out, sent "The Last Swallow: A
Reverie" to another Editor, and began again. The third time I was
successful.</p>
<p>Of course in my review I said all the usual things. I said that
Mr. Blank's attitude to life was "subjective rather than objective"
... and a little lower down that it was "objective rather than
subjective." I pointed out that in his treatment of the major theme
he was a neo-romanticist, but I suggested that, on the other hand,
he had nothing to learn from the Russians&mdash;or the Russians had
nothing to learn from him; I forget which. And finally I said (and
this is the cause of the whole trouble) that ANTOINE VAURELLE'S
world-famous classic&mdash;and I looked it up in the
Encyclopaedia&mdash;world-renowned classic, <i>Je Comprends
Tout</i>, had been not without its influence on Mr. Blank. It was a
good review, and the editor was pleased about it.</p>
<p>A few days later Mr. Blank wrote to say that, curiously enough,
he had never read <i>Je Comprends Tout</i>. It didn't seem to me
very curious, because I had never read it either, but I thought it
rather odd of him to confess as much to a stranger. The only book
of VAURELLE'S which I had read was <i>Consolatrice</i>, in an
English translation. However, one doesn't say these things in a
review.</p>
<p>Now I have a French friend, Henri, one of those annoying
Frenchmen who talks English much better than I do, and Henri, for
some extraordinary reason, had seen my review. He has to live in
London now, but his heart is in Paris; and I imagine that every
word of his beloved language which appears, however casually, in an
English paper mysteriously catches his eye and brings the scent and
sounds of the <i>boulevards</i> to him across the coffee-cups. So
the next time I met him he shook me warmly by the hand, and told me
how glad he was that I was an admirer of ANTOINE VAURELLE'S
novels.</p>
<p>"Who isn't?" I said with a shrug, and, to get the conversation
on to safer ground, I added hastily that in some ways I almost
liked <i>Consolatrice</i> best.</p>
<p>He shook my hand again. So did he. A great book.</p>
<p>"But of course," he said, "one must read it in the original
French. It is the book of all others which loses by
translation."</p>
<p>"Of course," I agreed. Really, I don't see what else I could
have done.</p>
<p>"Do you remember that wonderful phrase &mdash;&mdash;" and he
rattled it off. "Magnificent, is it not?"</p>
<p>"Magnificent," I said, remembering an appointment instead.
"Well, I must be getting on. Good-bye." And, as I walked off, I
patted my forehead with my handkerchief and wondered why the day
had grown so warm suddenly.</p>
<p>However the next day was even warmer. Henri came to see me with
a book under his arm. We all have one special book of our own which
we recommend to our acquaintances, regarding the love of it as
perhaps the best passport to our friendship. This was Henri's. He
was about to test me. I had read and admired his favourite
VAURELLES&mdash;in the original French. Would I love his daring
LAFORGUE? My reputation as a man, as a writer, as a critic,
depended on it. He handed me the book&mdash;in French.</p>
<p>"It is all there," he said reverently, as he gave it to me. "All
your English masters, they all come from him. Perhaps, most of all
your &mdash;&mdash; But you shall tell me when you have read it.
You shall tell me whom most you seem to see there. Your MEREDITH?
Your SHAW? Your &mdash;&mdash; But you shall tell me."</p>
<p>"I will tell you," I said faintly.</p>
<p>And I've got to tell him.</p>
<p>Don't think that I shall have any difficulty in reading the
book. Glancing through it just now I came across this:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>'Kate, avez-vous soup&eacute; avant le spectacle?'</i></p>
<p><i>'Non, je n'avais gu&egrave;re le coeur &agrave; manger.'"</i></p>
<p>Well, that's easy enough. But I doubt if it is one of the most
characteristic passages. It doesn't give you a clue to LAFORGUE'S
manner, any more than "'Must I sit here, mother?' 'Yes, without a
doubt you must,'" tells you all that you want to know about
MEREDITH. There's more in it than that.</p>
<p>And I've got to tell him.</p>
<p>But fancy holding forth on an author's style after reading him
laboriously with a dictionary!</p>
<p>However, I must do my best; and in my more hopeful moments I see
the conversation going like this:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Oh, wonderful." <i>(With emotion)</i> "Really wonderful."</p>
<p>"You see them all there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. It's really&mdash;wonderful. MEREDITH&mdash;I
mean&mdash;well, it's simply&mdash;(<i>after a pause</i>)
wonderful."</p>
<p>"You see MEREDITH there most?"</p>
<p>"Y&mdash;yes. Sometimes. And then sometimes I&mdash;I don't"
(<i>with truth</i>). "It's difficult to say. Sometimes
I&mdash;er&mdash;SHAW&mdash;er&mdash;well, it's &mdash;&mdash;"
(<i>with a gesture somewhat Gallic</i>) "How can I put it?"</p>
<p>"Not THACKERAY at all?" he says, watching me eagerly.</p>
<p>I decide to risk it.</p>
<p>"Oh, but of course! I mean&mdash;THACKERAY! When I said MEREDITH
I was thinking of the <i>others</i>. But THACKERAY&mdash;I mean
THACKERAY <i>is</i>&mdash; er&mdash;" (<i>I've forgotten his name
for the moment and go on hastily</i>) I
mean&mdash;er&mdash;THACKERAY, obviously."</p>
<p>He shakes me by the hand. I am his friend.</p>
<p>But this conversation only takes place in my more hopeful
moments. In my less hopeful ones I see myself going into the
country for quite a long time.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p><i>Monday, May 12th</i>.&mdash;Lord FRENCH'S newspaper
revelations were brought to the notice of Mr. CHURCHILL, who
adduced the cases of the late Lords WOLSELEY and ROBERTS as
evidence that Field-marshals, when unemployed, have always been
allowed considerable freedom of criticism. The fact that Lord
FRENCH is Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and (nominal)
Commander-in-Chief of the considerable army employed in that
country makes no difference; but ordinary serving officers are
still subject to the Regulations and will take FRENCH leave at
their peril.</p>
<p>In the course of a further discussion on milk&mdash;prices,
about which the West Country is still up in arms, Mr. MCCURDY
dropped the remark that it was impossible to control cream, owing,
no doubt, to its notorious insurrectionary tendencies; and Colonel
WEIGALL removed a load of suspicion from some of our minds by the
emphatic declaration that "a cow was not a pump, of which the
supply could be turned off or on as one liked."</p>
<p>The FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS was not very hopeful about the
removal of the buildings which disfigure the Parks. The most he
could say was that he was doing his best to get the camouflage
school out of Kensington Gardens, and let nature have a chance.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, May 13th</i>.&mdash;The Lords defeated the
Government by inserting in the Ministry of Health Bill a provision
that the new Minister should have only one Parliamentary Secretary.
In vain Lord SANDHURST protested that the amendment would tie the
PRIME MINISTER'S hands. Lord MIDLETON was delighted to think that
it would. Lord CREWE declared that the creation of minor Ministers
was becoming a disease (possibly the Ministry of Health will
include it among "notifiable" epidemics?). Lord BLEDISLOE quoted
the old tag about big fleas and little fleas. But after all there
must be some check to the inveterate tendency to somnolence in the
public offices.</p>
<p>When the Ways and Communications Bill was before the Commons the
Minister-Designate buttressed his case with the alarming statement
that there would be a deficit of one hundred millions this year on
the working of the railways. Members were therefore surprised to
find in the Budget that only sixty millions was provided to meet
it. Even in these days a discrepancy of forty millions does not
pass entirely unnoticed. When taxed with it, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said
he thought it was due to Government traffic not having been allowed
for in the original calculation, but advised his questioner to ask
Sir ERIC GEDDES to explain. For some reason&mdash;can it be the
formidable appearance of the GEDDES chin?&mdash;Sir JOSEPH WALTON
did not seem greatly pleased at the prospect.</p>
<p>Like many another Chief Secretary before him, Mr. IAN
MACPHERSON, who reappeared in the House after a long absence in
Ireland, had to figure with a scourge in one hand and an olive
branch in the other. At Question-time he was the stern upholder of
law and order, obliged within the last few days to suspend a
seditious newspaper and to surround the Dublin Mansion House with
soldiers. A few moments later he was moving the Second Reading of a
most generous Housing Bill, under which Irish Corporations will be
enabled to build thousands of dwellings largely at the expense of
the general taxpayer.</p>

"FAILING TO DIFFER." /></a>FAILING TO DIFFER.<br />
SIR EDWARD CARSON AND MR. DEVLIN.</div>
<p>In his warm welcome to the measure Sir EDWARD CARSON revealed a
side of his character not often seen, except by his personal
friends. He was so sympathetic to the needs of the Irish
working-classes, so eloquent upon the benefits to health, sobriety
and contentment that good houses would secure, and so insistent
upon the necessity of making the new dwellings beautiful as well as
useful, that Mr. DEVLIN could do little more than say "ditto to Mr.
BURKE."</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, May 16th</i>.&mdash;Those persons, at home and
abroad, who persist in regarding the British as universal
land-grabbers will please note that Spitsbergen, despite the
undoubted fact that an Englishman landed there three centuries ago,
leaves us cold. Although no direct response was made to Mr.
ASHLEY'S suggestion that the future of the island should be
referred to the Coal Commission, it is widely felt that if Mr.
SMILLIE and Sir LEO CHIOZZA MONEY would volunteer to explore its
possibilities they would be doing the country signal service.</p>
<p>The drawbacks of having the Leadership of the Opposition in
commission were further exemplified when Sir DONALD MACLEAN in his
most impressive manner asked for a day to discuss Lord FRENCH'S
communications to the Press. Mr. BONAR LAW inquired if he desired
to move a Vote of Censure in his capacity as Leader of the
Opposition. "No, no," shouted the supporters of the rival
claimants, Mr. ADAMSON and Mr. GEORGE LAMBERT. Whereupon Sir DONALD
altered his tone and mildly observed that he only wanted to clear
up a constitutional point.</p>
<p>The debate on Mr. HARTSHORN'S motion regarding the state of
Ireland was unique of its kind in that not a single Member
representing an Irish constituency took the floor; but in spite of
that it produced more heat than light. Both the mover and the
seconder (Mr. SEXTON) were rich in denunciation of the present
Government of Ireland, but poverty-stricken in suggestions for its
improvement. Lord HENRY BENTINCK seized the opportunity to make
final recantation of his Unionist principles, but in default of
more practical proposals was reduced to imploring the people of
Ulster "to show some spirit of compromise;" and Lord HUGH CECIL in
a despairing moment declared that he would sooner see three-fourths
of Ireland independent than the whole of it presented with a form
of Home Rule which no Irishman desired. After that one appreciated
Sir KEITH ERASER'S remark, that during four years' soldiering in
Ireland he had only met one man who understood the Irish Question,
and he was an Englishman who had only been there a week!</p>
<p><i>Thursday, May 15th</i>.&mdash;The intelligent <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>[pg 406]</span>
foreigner who should try to disentangle the causes of Egyptian
unrest from the speeches delivered in both Houses this afternoon
will be rather puzzled. From Captain WEDGWOOD BENN in the Commons
he would learn that it was due to the ineptitude of the British
Administration, the ill-treatment of the natives by the Army of
Occupation, and in particular the unsympathetic attitude adopted by
Lord CURZON towards the Nationalist leaders, one of whom, according
to Captain BENN, "held in Egypt a position comparable with that of
Mr. Speaker here." Across the corridor at the very same moment Lord
CURZON was asserting that Egypt was enjoying extraordinary material
prosperity, that the British soldiery had shown wonderful restraint
in very trying circumstances and that the Government had not the
least desire to repress Egyptian individuality (when not too
exuberant, of course) or deny to natives an ever-increasing share
in the administration of their country. They would have been quite
ready to listen to ZAGHLUL and his friends if they had not begun by
demanding the complete disappearance of British rule. The
intelligent foreigner will probably come to the conclusion that
Egypt is very like Ireland&mdash;except that it has no Ulster.</p>
<p>General SEELY gave a fairly plausible explanation of the
apparently wanton destruction of new aeroplanes that is going on at
Farnborough and elsewhere. Owing to the rapid progress in aviation
they were already obsolete for military purposes before they were
delivered. They are quite unsuitable for civilian use, and are
therefore being "reduced to produce"&mdash;a euphemism for
"scrapped."</p>
<p>Mr. SHORTT was not in his place, but the interests of the Home
Department did not suffer in the hands of the Under-Secretary. Sir
HAMAR GEEENWOOD rattles out his replies with the speed and accuracy
of a machine-gun, and has a neat formula for dealing with
"supplementaries": "All these further Questions are covered by my
original answer."</p>

<h2>MORE MUSICAL RECONSTRUCTION.</h2>
<p class="center"><i>(By our Special Reporter, who is also busy
with the Coal Commission.)</i></p>
<p>At the three hundred and seventeenth sitting of the Musical
Reconstruction Commission Mr. Justice Bland, the President, said he
felt sure he would be voicing the feelings of all present in
tendering his congratulations to Sir Leonardo Spaghetti Coyne on
his elevation to the peerage as Viscount Vermicelli of Milan, and
to Mr. Gladney Jebb on receiving the honour of K.P.O. (Knight of
the Proletarian Order).</p>
<p>A memorandum on the economics of the Russian Ballet and the
probable cost of its reorganisation on a Marxian basis was read by
Mr. Ploffskin of the Garden City Gymnosophist Guild. By a scheme
for a uniform salary for all dancers, compulsory vegetarian diet,
and the exclusive use of the balalaika, Mr. Ploffskin was of
opinion that a Bolshevist Ballet might be safely organised so as to
satisfy the artistic aspirations of the proletariat and counteract
the pernicious influences of the pseudo-Ethiopian style affected by
the idle rich.</p>
<p>Examined by Sir Edwin Edgar, O.M., Mr. Ploffskin admitted that
none of the famous Russian composers of recent years had associated
themselves with the Revolutionary movement, and that the Russian
Ballet had originally been an integral part of the Imperial Opera.
But he had no doubt that on a proper proletarian basis it would
function with a far more beneficent activity. He pointed out that
there was a strong facial resemblance between TROTSKY and M.
PADEREWSKI, and between LENIN and BEETHOVEN. In reply to a question
from Mr. Moody MacTear, Mr. Ploffskin said that he had been down a
coal-mine in Siberia.</p>
<p>Sir Mark Holloway, who next occupied the witness's chair,
admitted, in reply to the questions of Sir Gladney Jebb, that,
since his student days, he had seldom been engaged in manual labour
on any instrument for more than two hours a day. It was not
necessary for a conductor. But he knew of pianists who practised
for six or even eight hours a day with impunity.</p>
<p><i>Sir Gladney Jebb</i>. Do you not think that if all
compositions were written in the key of C it would materially
conduce to the greatest happiness of the greatest number?&mdash;The
President has already deprecated the multiplication of hypothetical
questions, which have reached a total of more than fifteen
thousand.</p>
<p><i>Viscount Vermicelli</i>. Do you think that the unrestrained
performance of Jazz-music conduces to the moral betterment of the
simian proletariat?&mdash;That seems to me to be a question which
bears on the administration of the Unnecessary Noises Act.</p>
<p>Are you in favour of the establishment of a Ministry for the
Control of Syncopation?&mdash;No; but I would cordially support a
Bill for the Compulsory Segregation of Irresponsible
Collectivists.</p>
<p>In reply to Mr. Moody MacTear, Sir Mark Holloway said that he
had never been down a coal-mine, but that he had a few shares in a
gold-mine, which had cost him five pounds a-piece, but had never
borne any dividends and were now quoted at one-and-sixpence.</p>
<p>The next witness, Dame Frisca, the famous Californian singer,
was subjected to a remarkably severe examination by Mr. Moody
MacTear.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Moody MacTear</i>. Do you consider that the assumption of
the title <i>prima donna</i> is compatible with democratic
principles?&mdash;I never assumed it; it was bestowed on me by the
free suffrages of the musical world.</p>
<p><i>Mr. MacTear</i>. Then you admit that you possess it. Are you
prepared to submit proof of your title to the
Commission?&mdash;Certainly; but it would probably mean bringing
forty van-loads of press-cuttings and cause considerable congestion
of traffic.</p>
<p><i>Mr. MacTear</i>. Is it not the case that the <i>prima
donna</i> has been condemned by the best musical critics as an
obsolete anachronism, tending to perpetuate the abuses of the
"star" system and to foster breaches of the Decalogue and to
enhance the soloist at the expense of the chorus?&mdash;I believe
that WAGNER <span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id=
"page407"></a>[pg 407]</span> held the view expressed in the
opening part of your question, but he was unable to get on without
her, wrote a famous address to the Star of Eve, and gave the chorus
practically nothing to do in many of his operas.</p>
<p><i>Mr. MacTear</i>. Is it not the case that the operatic tenor
has been pronounced on good authority to be not a man but a
disease?&mdash;The authority was a German conductor, who was
presumably speaking of German tenors.</p>
<p><i>Mr. MacTear</i>. Have you ever been down a
coal-mine?&mdash;No; but I was presented with a diamond brooch by
the diggers of Kimberley.</p>

<h2>"DIAMOND-CUT-DIAMOND."</h2>
<p>This is to warn all honest men to beware of No. 007 Field
Company, R.E., known to its victims as "Chaucer's Gang," the most
conscienceless crew of body-snatchers and common thieves in all the
B.E.F.</p>
<p>I am myself no fastidious precisian, being in a Labour Company,
but there are limits&mdash;or should be. My own particular grouch
against them started at Ripilly-sur-Somme. They, being skilled
Royal Engineers, were clearing undergrowth and putting up huts in
Ripilly woods for a division due to arrive, and my scorned rabble
were unloading the huts in sections from barges at Ripilly canal
wharf and loading them on to lorries for transport to the woods.
Chaucer and his Royal Engineers were living on the
spot&mdash;Ardennes waving o'er them her green leaves and so
forth&mdash;and we were in rest billets (loud roars of raucous
laughter) in Ripilly village, the least sanitary spot in the whole
war zone.</p>
<p>Chaucer wouldn't let us stay with him in the huts&mdash;said the
Chief Engineer was very keen on men living next their work. But
between Ripilly and the canal wharf was an ideal spot. The chalk
downs sloped steeply to the river, and halfway down was a bit of a
level plateau just the size for a couple of huts. South aspect;
good fishing and bathing; a home from home. The woods hid it from
view above and the roadside poplars from below. It was a truly
desirable building site.</p>
<p>We had a hurdle-maker in our company, so I gave him a brace of
light-duty men as apprentices and they built a little hut of wattle
and daub. It had a nice rural appearance and was warm, but it
leaked in wet weather, and the more I thought of Chaucer lying dry
under his felt roofs the worse I felt about it. So I had a chat
with my sergeant at the wharf, and the long and short of it was
that two walls and one roof got delivered by mistake at the
desirable building-site.</p>
<p>We worked late that night, and next day had thirty men in
residence, with one end of the long hut partitioned off for
Simmonds, my subaltern, and myself.</p>
<p>So far so good. I began to think about making another mistake
and getting a second hut, but that evening Chaucer came sliding
down over the steep turf, visibly annoyed.</p>
<p>"Where did you get this hut?"</p>
<p>"Found it."</p>
<p>"On Ripilly wharf?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not. I found it down there by the road and had it
brought up here for safety. If a lorry had run over it in the
dark&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, cut it out," he said. "The hut is mine. I found two odd
sections in the last barge-load. Any poacher who knew his job would
burn the feathers when he cooked the bird. You needn't start to
explain about your fool N.C.O., who made a mistake. I keep that
sort of N.C.O. myself. <i>If</i> I get an official inquiry about
this hut I shall send back official information."</p>
<p>"Right-o! Then come in and have a drink, and don't be official
before you need."</p>
<p>That's where I was wrong. I tried to enlist the blighter's
sympathy. Showed him round camp, the view, the
bathing&mdash;everything. When Simmonds came up from the river with
a string of roach Chaucer admitted it was a truly <i>bon</i>
billet.</p>
<p>Next day he called again with one of his subalterns, a creature
called Gubson, who went down to the river to watch Simmonds fish.
When he had gone Chaucer told me he had a spare hut.</p>
<p>"Not one of these divisional huts, but a thing we knocked up
ourselves. We've nearly finished our job here, and if it's any use
to you you can have it. But mind you, I know nothing about this
other hut you've got here. If you're caught with that one your
blood be on your own head."</p>
<p>"You're a Christian," I told him, and, Gubson and Simmonds
returning, the conference had a drink and adjourned.</p>
<p>Next day I found quite a squad of light-duty men, and sent 'em
to dismantle and bring down Chaucer's hut. I admit they rather
exceeded instructions, for they brought a lot of things that
Chaucer had omitted to mention. However, they said he was there
when they took them, so I supposed it was all right. Besides the
hut they had two bell-tents, a big tarpaulin, some corrugated iron
and expanded metal, some home-made chairs and tables, a water-tank
and a field kitchen, with its wheels broken off&mdash;a noble lot
of loot it was. They worked like beavers bringing it down and
getting it in place, and when Chaucer drifted down again at the end
of the week all my men were housed there as snug as you please.
Finally Gubson presented the camp with a punt he had salved in
Sailly village&mdash;and there we were, all the pleasures of the
Riviera and none of the disreputable company.</p>
<p>We were so pleased with all they had done for us that we
suggested they should stay the night and celebrate the occasion.
Chaucer said he would be delighted, if we would send to his batman
and tell him to bring down his razor and toothbrush. At midnight,
when the batman arrived, Chaucer said it was time for bed. And
could we give his man a shake-down, please? It was pretty dark, he
said, and the fool might lose his way home.</p>
<p>That should have warned me. Chaucer wasn't the man to keep a
batman who was a fool.</p>
<p>It must have been about 3 A.M. when I was waked by my man
helping Chaucer dress.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Your fellow says my man's ill."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I dunno, Sir," my man said. "'E 's groanin' an' rollin' about
an' keepin' all us others awake."</p>
<p>When I got to the men's hut I found Chaucer kneeling beside the
sick man, who was holding his head and groaning. All the other men
were sitting up and looking on. After a minute or two Chaucer got
up and beckoned me outside.</p>
<p>"Look here," he said, "I don't want to scare you, but suppose
that chap's got anything infectious. Is there a doctor handy?</p>
<p>"Nowhere nearer than Sailly."</p>
<p>"Well, Gubson tells me they were expecting the M.O. at our camp
today. He may have stayed the night. Can you send somebody up to
see?"</p>
<p>I sent off an orderly at once, and in half-an-hour a young
doctor arrived, and ordered all the other men out of the hut. Then
he pulled a gaudy handkerchief out of his pocket, sprinkled it with
some stuff out of a small phial, tied it over his mouth and only
then began to fiddle about the sick man, feeling his pulse and
sounding him.</p>
<p>Then he got up, readjusted his handkerchief-respirator and
mumbled that it was cerebro-spinal-something. Spotted fever.</p>
<p>We all got out of that hut in double-quick time, believe me. The
doctor was full of orders&mdash;half a hundred things to do at
once. The man must be strictly isolated. All the
contacts&mdash;every blessed man who had been in the hut with
him&mdash;must be placed under supervision. The hut must be put out
of bounds. And when he found half the men had gone under the
tarpaulin shelter he put that out of bounds too.</p>
<p>We were a full hour trying to separate the contacts; but when
the doctor found the cook getting breakfast ready and heard he had
been in the sick man's hut he threw his hand in.</p>
<p>"I won't answer for a single one of you," he said; "the place is
no better than a pest-house. Throw that breakfast away. It's sheer
poison. Clear out, all of you."</p>
<p>It was Chaucer started the panic. I saw him sneaking away up the
slope, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>[pg
409]</span> so I thought it better to make a move too. I didn't ask
the doctor where we were to go; he'd have had us all sleeping out
on the open grass for a week if I had. So the whole lot of us, half
asleep, trekked back to Ripilly village and turned into our old
billets again.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It was my Sergeant-Major who told me next day that Chaucer and
his gang had taken possession of the Riviera&mdash;my Riviera. I
went there at once, to find out what it all meant, but they had a
sentry at the foot of the slope, who said the camp was infected and
no one was allowed there; so I climbed the slopes and looked down
from above. Chaucer was smoking outside my pet hut talking to a
couple of his subalterns, and a string of men was lined up beside
the field kitchen for tea. Close by, the batman, recovered from his
illness, was putting a fishing-rod together, and one of the
subalterns blew his nose on a gaudy handkerchief which I recognised
at once.</p>
<p>I went straight back and told the Town Major of Ripilly that one
of the new divisional huts was being occupied by the Sappers. It
wasn't cricket, but it was all I could do.</p>
<p>"That's all right," he said. "Chaucer's acting as divisional
R.E. He's entitled to one hut. He told me he had been arranging for
you to erect it for him."</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>
<p class="center">"CYRANO" MOVES TO DRURY LANE.</p>
<p>SIR THOMAS BEECHAM, having been translated to another place, has
made way for <i>Cyrano</i> and his nose, which now finds more room
to turn round in. I had not seen Mr. LORAINE on the more congested
stage of the Garrick. Indeed the last time that I assisted at M.
ROSTAND'S play was some twenty years ago in the South of France. It
happened that there had recently been a vogue of Musketeer plays in
England. Behind my seat was a British Baronet (a recent creation)
for whom the French language had little or no meaning. The first
and only sign of intelligence that he showed was well on in the
performance, at the words, "<i>Qui est ce monsieur?" "C'est
D'Artagnan." (D'Artagnan</i> then disappears altogether).</p>
<p>"Another of these damned Musketeer plays," said the Bart.; "I'm
off!" And he went.</p>
<p>I am not sure that, even in English, it would have been just the
play for his taste; but that London has plenty of people who can
appreciate it may be seen by the way in which Mr. LORAINE can hold
the great auditorium under the spell of its romance. Without an
effort he endears to us the defects of his hero's Quixotic
qualities, and makes his very deformity contribute to the triumph
of his heroic <i>panache</i>. Even such of the poet's prolixities
as survive a very careful pruning of the text are made to seem
essential to the self-expression of character.</p>
<p>Mr. LORAINE is happy in his book, for the clever rendering made
by Miss GLADYS THOMAS and Miss MARY GUILLEMARD reproduces both the
spirit and the letter of the poem. And from his cast he gets all
the support that he needs. True, he needs very little. He fills the
stage, and the other characters&mdash;notably the colourless
<i>Christian de Neuvillette</i>&mdash;are little more than his
foils. Miss STELLA CAMPBELL, as <i>Roxane</i>, failed, at times, to
convey a sense of overwhelming passion either for the body of
<i>Christian</i> or the soul which she imagined it to contain; but
she was always a gracious figure and her voice was gentle. Perhaps
Mr. LORAINE owed most to his scenic artists, Messrs. DULAC and JOHN
BULL, who gave of their best. There was attraction too in the very
names of Arras and Bapaume, as well as in the thought of the part
that our <i>Cyrano</i> of to-day has played against a ruder foe
than the Spaniard. And was I wrong in tracing a hint of other
experiences gained at the front, when Mr. LORAINE nearly turned up
his false nose at the mention of "military wit."</p>
<p>The part offers little scope for humour. <i>Cyrano</i>, with all
his generous impulses, is too self-conscious for that. But in each
of his moods and phases&mdash;bravado, sacrifice, acceptance of the
inexorable pathos of things&mdash;Mr. LORAINE had got at the heart
of the man. A very brave and inspiring performance.</p>

<h2>THE DAY.</h2>
<p>At last the great day has arrived; in less than half an hour I
shall be at the church. Heavens! what excitement. And yet I suppose
most girls have had to undergo the ordeal, if one may so describe
it, at some period of their life.</p>
<p>The magic church is not far distant and from my room I can hear
the merry pealing of the bells. In the garden the birds are singing
as they have never sung before. Truly life is a beautiful poem on
such a day as this.</p>
<p>But I have really little time to dwell on these things, for am I
not the centre of creation itself, the hub around which the whole
household revolves in one wild bewildering whirl of ecstasy? How
can one think when one is surrounded by a triumphant mother, a
couple of adoring and not envious sisters, a critical brother and a
doting father?</p>
<p>But then why should I think? Why use my brain at all when all
the thinking that needs to be thought is being thought for me?
Goodness, how my poor head reels. If only I could sleep. Ah, yes,
that is what I could almost wish for at this moment&mdash;sweet,
soothing, refreshing sleep.</p>
<p>But it is not to be; the house is just a great tearing
pandemonium of joy. Hark! What's that? A motor horn? Yes, yes, a
taxi is at the gate. Now another has glided forward and waits
expectantly for the central figure&mdash;myself.</p>
<p>"Well, darling," murmurs my father, "it's high time we were off.
Wouldn't do to be late today, you know." And he laughs proudly.</p>
<p>Can I describe the journey to the church? I can, but I will
spare you. Enough to say that I carry myself with dignity. Whether
I do so in the vast solemn atmosphere of the church I am unable to
say, though I will confess to a feeling almost of awe.</p>
<p>In deep silence we move down the aisle. The service begins. Can
I repeat it? I fear not. But one passage there is which stands out
prominently from the rest. It is in the form of a demand made by
the clergyman. Looking steadily at my father, he
exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Name this child</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am roused to a fresh interest, and with fast-beating heart I
await my father's answer. It comes as a bombshell to my sensitive
ears:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Armisticia Beatty Zeebrugge!</i>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I believed that only Germans could wage war on helpless
babes.</p>

<h3>SPRING-TIME IN THE OFFICE.</h3>
</div>
<hr />
<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p class="center"><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
Clerks.)</i></p>
<p>Books dealing with life at the Front have naturally somewhat
slackened in volume of late. Perhaps this accounts for some part of
my interest in <i>Pushed and the Return Push</i> (BLACKWOOD). But
more must be put down to the lure of the subject, and most of all
to the admirable way in which the writer, who chooses to be known
as "QUEX," has dealt with it. Briefly, the book is a record of the
two great sensational movements of 1918, and of the writer's
experiences as an officer of an Artillery Brigade in the retreat
forced upon the Fifth Army by the break through of the Germans on
March 21st, and subsequently in the return push which broke the
Hindenburg Lino and ended the War. The publishers say that this is
the only account yet written by a participator in these happenings;
I hardly think that any will appear more vivid and moving. The
amazing sequence of the events with which it deals gives to the
book the thrill of arranged drama, in which disaster is balanced by
the triumphant ending. However unskilfully told, such a history
could hardly fail of its effect; by good fortune, however, it finds
in "QUEX" a chronicler able to do it justice. Simply and without
apparent effort he conveys the suspense of the days before the
attack (a couple of chapters here are as breathlessly exciting as
anything that I have yet read in the literature of the War), the
long trial of the retreat, and finally the retaliation and the
ever-quickening rush forward from victory to victory that makes
last autumn seem like an age of miracles. It is essentially a
soldier's story, at times technical, throughout filled with the
unflurried all-in-the-day's-work philosophy that upheld our armies
in every change of fortune. For many reasons a volume that should
find its place in any collection of the smaller histories of the
Great War.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Until I had very nearly reached the end of <i>The Cormorant</i>
(MELROSE) I could not, though I tried, make up my mind as to which
of three possible claimants was filling the title-role. When I did
discover the "Cormorant's" identity with a fourth person quite
unsuspected, I found myself just a little inclined to wonder
whether perhaps the authoress had not had the mystification of her
readers as her real aim when she chose her title, and merely
introduced a pleasant American, who called people names with a
sincerity few of us would dare to imitate, in order to justify her
choice. But all the same I am not going to tell her secret here,
for I feel that much will be added to the interest of a very
pleasant book if readers will pause long enough at the end of
chapter sixteen to try to "spot" the "Cormorant" and&mdash;as I
hope and believe&mdash;guess wrong. Miss ANN (or ANNE, for her
publishers seem to be in two minds about it) WEAVER has compounded
her tale from the somewhat ordinary ingredients of a heroine, as
aggressively red-haired as only red-haired heroines can be; a
philandering but finally faithful hero; a worthless but charming
married man, and a number of less important people, many of whom
are well drawn, though I think that I have met that scheming and
malicious French maid before. <i>The Cormorant's</i> lines are
chiefly laid in country houses of the more delightful sort and the
story is well told. When Miss WEAVER invents a more distinguished
plot she should do something very good indeed.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. HORACE BLEACKLEY'S <i>Anymoon</i> (LANE) is a reasonably
diverting because superbly improbable account of England under the
new Socialist Commonwealth, with <i>Joseph <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>[pg 412]</span>
Anymoon</i>, a highly popular Cockney plebeian, as President.
Follows an era of feminist control and a Bolshevist revolution
contrived by one <i>Cohen</i> (with the authentic properties,
"Crimson Guards" and purple morality), and finally the Restoration
through the loyalist Navy, the complacent <i>Anymoon</i> consoling
himself with the reflection that if he was a failure as CROMWELL he
can at least be a success as General MONK. Perhaps the wilder
critics of the present order have no reason to complain if their
impatient generalisations are marshalled, however disingenuously,
against them. But the judicious folk of every school who are now
trying to take their bearings may wonder if much is to be gained by
putting up and knocking down such flimsy figures of straw. Mr.
HAROLD COX contributes a rather too solemn preface, which labels
this otherwise irresponsible novel as a serious tract. I rather
think that the engaging spectacle of the biographer of WILKES and
the editor of <i>The Edinburgh</i> (the author of <i>The New
Republic</i> surely somewhere in the offing) crouching among the
headstones with a candle in a hollow turnip will make a certain
appeal to those with a sense of humour and proportion ... The
others may like it even better.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Nothing could be more attractive than the central idea of <i>The
Love Spinner</i> (METHUEN), which is to tell the war-time
adventures of a little old lady&mdash;the good fairy of her
circle&mdash;whose interest in the heart-affairs of her friends
wins her this pleasant if slightly sentimental title. But,
ungrateful as is the task of breaking so innocent a butterfly upon
the wheel of criticism, I'm afraid I must add that I think Miss
CLARA TURNBULL has hardly carried out her purpose with sufficient
discrimination. In plain fact she has allowed her sympathies to run
away with her. Such a character as <i>Miss Jessie</i>, who goes
about doing good, and producing incidentally the most benevolent
reactions in confirmed misanthropes, demands to be handled with the
nicest care if sentimentality is to be avoided. Let me put it that
Miss TURNBULL has not always been entirely successful in this
respect. Thus, despite some agreeable scenes, the book remains one
for the unsophisticated, or for those whose appetite for fictional
glucose is robust. There is not very much that can be called plot;
what there is concerns itself with the fortunes of <i>Miss
Jessie's</i> tenants, the chief objects of her ministrations. In
the end an air-raid, of which the details are surely unusual,
provides <i>Miss Jessie</i> with the opportunity for a deed of
heroism that I am still trying to visualize (her nephew had thrown
her down and was protecting her body with his own; but the heroine,
seeing this, changed places with her defender "between the flash of
the shell's impact and the explosion") and finishes, with an
appropriately tearful death-scene, a tale that would have been
improved by more restraint in the telling.</p>
<p>In <i>The Thunderbolt</i> (UNWIN) <i>Georgina Bonham</i>, at
home and amongst her intimates, delighted in small-talk. It flowed
in an unceasing stream, particularly when <i>Dr. Rayke</i>, her
chief adviser and confidant, came to tea and ate his favourite
currant-and-sultana cake. Everything, in fact, prepares you for one
of the tamest of all tame novels, when suddenly the "Thunderbolt"
of the title remembers its attributes and bursts from a clear sky.
Thenceforward Mr. GEORGE COLMORE'S book is of a particularly
painful character. For the horrors which here accumulate on
horror's head I find no adequate excuse, even though the villain of
the story is a German.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Blanche Maddison</i>, the heroine of <i>The Obstinate
Lady</i> (HUTCHINSON), might without any excess of rudeness be
called pig-headed. With her case in my mind let me advise women who
have married disgusting men to seek whatever shelter the law may
give them rather than adopt her persistently cold and aloof manner.
I hardly wonder that her husband found her a little exasperating.
We all know Mr. W.E. NORRIS as a novelist who can be trusted not
only to tell an intriguing story, but also to construct it
irreproachably. But here, I think, he has penalised himself with
the materials he has chosen. However he sets bravely to work to
wipe off his handicap, and very nearly succeeds. If I cannot credit
him with complete success it is because the subsidiary tale of love
which he gives us is really too anaemic. Yet I can conceive of
people so fed up with the makers of blood-heat fiction that Mr.
NORRIS'S lukewarm method will afford them a pleasant change.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>However cleverly Mr. WILLIAM CAINE may treat his theme, <i>The
Wife Who Came Alive</i> (JENKINS) is only another version of the
antiquated mother-in-law business. <i>Doll Brackett</i> was a
beautiful American girl, and if she had not been idiotically
idolised by her mother and could have realised the difference
between pounds and pence she might have made an excellent wife for
<i>George March</i>, of Hampstead, portrait-painter. <i>Mrs.
Brackett</i> was not actively hostile to this marriage, but after
losing her fortune she began to disapprove of the economy which
<i>March</i> preached and tried in vain to practise. Persuaded that
her idol was no longer becomingly enshrined, she proceeded to make
trouble between husband and wife, and they separated. Then followed
a very lean time both for <i>Mrs. Brackett</i> and her daughter,
until at last the former made such an outrageous proposal that
<i>Doll</i> came to her senses. You will easily believe that this
sort of subject offers no very favourable outlet for Mr. CAINE'S
particular gifts, but the confidential style in which he tells the
story is distinctly engaging, and as a warning to foolish
mothers-in-law it is something more than adequate.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
